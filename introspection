Why must we choose you?

Well but i dont have an answer for that.Frankly speaking i am not aware of any type of coding till joining this campus.But i am eagerly waiting to learn as much as possible and prove my abilities.I am not commanding you take me but i am requesting that give me a chance and i am giving a word that i will never make you think again of that decision

what is your plan for the next 6 months?

I want to build up my skills in open source coding and building the ability to build apps.But i am not sure that how the next 6 months look like but i will try my best to do as planned.

How would you contribute back to the club?

I will contribute to the club with my all abilities and i will guide the freshers as my seniors does for me thanks for their support

Do you have any feedback on the selection process?

I have no feedback because my lecturers and seniors are packing up all their energy for this process and working hard.So by seeing their hard work i could not give any feedback but one thing i know is that they wll choose the best way to select the members
